### Problem 
 * Successful volunteer experiences require planning time and creativity to develop
 * Loss of project continuity from one volunteer to the next
 * Projects left unfinished
 * New/inexperienced volunteers may not have the skills necessary to create their own lessons
 * Training volunteers takes time away from already overwhelmed non-profit staff
 
 ### Solution
 * Creative ideas are not lost but improved throughout time
 * The objective from the previous lessons are preserved so that each volunteer   does not have start from scratch
